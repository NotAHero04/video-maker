# Important announcement!

After June 30th, Reddit's API policy has changed. However, this repository will still work, because it doesn't touch any API call. That doesn't mean it will be future-proof, though.

# video-maker
Automatically creates videos. Run the workflow to try out!

(Based on [this bot.](https://github.com/elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot))

Before spamming at the "Run workflow" button, you should know two things:

- It's easy, right? Pay some respect for your favorite YouTubers who spend days making good videos.

- NEVER ABUSE THIS. BEWARE OF THE DIMINISHING RETURNS! You can't expect any person to "ask Reddit" 69 times a day.
