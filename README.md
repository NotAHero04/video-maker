# video-maker
Automatically creates videos. Run the workflow to try out!

(Based on [this bot.](https://github.com/elebumm/RedditVideoMakerBot))

Before spamming at the "Run workflow" button, you should know two things:

- It's easy, right? Pay some respect for your favorite YouTubers who spend days making a good video.

- NEVER ABUSE THIS. BEWARE OF THE DIMINISHING RETURNS! You can't expect any person to "ask Reddit" 69 times a day.
